   - The hashed value is logged to the console.

8. **Debugging**
   - Identifies and fixes errors in the `testdebug.html` file, with details on each error line.

9. **Login and Logout Functionality**
   - Implements a login form with local storage for the username and password.
   - Logic to:
     - Hide the logout button and welcome message initially.
     - Display the welcome message and logout button upon successful login.
     - Clear local storage and reset visibility on logout.

10. **Node.js Project with Express**
   - A Node.js project using Express that includes two API endpoints:

11. **Request Header Validation**
   - Adds custom headers to API requests:
     - `User-id: ifabula`
     - `Scope: user`
   - Validates the headers, responding with:
     ```json
     {
       "responseCode": 401,
       "responseMessage": "UNAUTHORIZED"
     }
     ```
     if the headers do not match.
